package common

// This file is intended to centralize miscellaneous constants.
// However, most constants have been moved to more specific files within pkg/common
// (e.g., paths.go, components.go, roles_labels.go, types.go, images.go, etc.)
// to promote better organization and modularity as per design documents.

// If any truly global, miscellaneous constants are identified that do not fit
// into other categories, they can be placed here. Otherwise, this file might
// be a candidate for removal if all constants find a more specific home.

// Example of a truly generic constant that might remain or be added:
// const (
//    DefaultApplicationName = "kubexm"
// )
// For now, keeping it minimal.
